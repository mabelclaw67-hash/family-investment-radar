# 家庭投资雷达 / Family Investment Radar V1.2

A lightweight family investment monitoring WebUI backed by Google Sheets.
All data comes from `Family_Investment_Radar_Master` via Apps Script Web App.

---

## Run locally

```bash
cd "/Users/mabelchen/Mabel Project/02_Family Investment/02_Web_Project"
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Open: http://127.0.0.1:5173/

On first load you will see the **password gate**. In dev mode (when the password
is still the placeholder `CHANGE_ME_BEFORE_DEPLOY`) any input is accepted.

---

## Password gate

The site requires a password before showing any content.

Password is read from (first match wins):

1. `VITE_FAMILY_INVESTMENT_SITE_PASSWORD` env variable (Netlify / .env file)
2. Falls back to `"CHANGE_ME_BEFORE_DEPLOY"` (dev placeholder — accepts any input)

To set locally, create `.env` in the project root:

```text
VITE_FAMILY_INVESTMENT_SITE_PASSWORD=YourRealPassword
```

**Never commit `.env` with the real password.** `.env` is in `.gitignore`.

The password is stored in `sessionStorage` — the gate reappears when the tab is closed.
A **退出 / Lock** button in the sidebar logs out immediately.

## Netlify deployment checklist

Before deploying, complete all steps:

**Step 1 — Set site password**

In Netlify UI → Site settings → Environment variables → Add:
```
VITE_FAMILY_INVESTMENT_SITE_PASSWORD = YourRealFamilyPassword
```
Do NOT leave it as `CHANGE_ME_BEFORE_DEPLOY` in production.

**Step 2 — Confirm Apps Script Web App URL**

In `src/config.js`, verify `FAMILY_INVESTMENT_API_URL` points to the correct deployed
Apps Script Web App URL. The URL must be publicly accessible (deployed as "Anyone").

**Step 3 — Confirm no mock data**

All pages must load from the live Google Sheets API. Do not enable mock/stub data.
The app shows an error state if the API is unreachable — that is the correct behaviour.

**Step 4 — Test mobile view**

Before deploy, open browser DevTools → toggle device toolbar → set width 390px.
Verify:
- Password gate shows correctly on phone width
- Bottom tab bar appears (首页 / 持仓 / 观察 / 记录)
- Sidebar is hidden
- Holdings, Watchlist, Decision Log show as card lists (not tables)
- Watchlist popup opens full-screen
- Decision Log form is single-column
- All forms can be submitted without horizontal scroll

**Step 5 — Deploy**

Drag and drop the `02_Web_Project` folder to Netlify, or connect via Git.
`netlify.toml` is already configured for static deployment with SPA redirect.

## Google Sheets source

Spreadsheet: `Family_Investment_Radar_Master`
ID: `1mNmAtxQn9udMm0ljuX1nCJKif_VhvhFhkWxNZBJgBBs`

API URL is configured in `src/config.js`:
```js
export const FAMILY_INVESTMENT_API_URL = "https://script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec";
```

All API keys (NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage) stay in Apps Script `PropertiesService`.
No API keys are exposed in the frontend.
